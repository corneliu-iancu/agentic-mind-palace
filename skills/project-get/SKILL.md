# Get Project

## State

This skill needs the database IDs that `setup` discovered. Resolve the state file
the same way every skill does — via the shared resolver — then read from it:

```bash
STATE_FILE="$(bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/state-file.sh")"
[ -f "$STATE_FILE" ] || { echo "Not set up — run /agentic-mind-palace:setup"; exit 1; }
cat "$STATE_FILE"   # { "databases": { ... } }
```

`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is the only anchor that is reliable inside a plugin
(`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` comes through empty here), and it is used only to *locate*
the resolver — the resolver itself stores the *data* outside the versioned plugin
directory so a version bump cannot orphan it. If the file is missing, tell the
user to run `/agentic-mind-palace:setup`.

## Steps

1. Call `mcp__notion__API-retrieve-a-page` with the page ID — extract all properties
2. Call `mcp__notion__API-get-block-children` with the page ID — get full page content
3. If any block has `has_children: true`, fetch its children recursively

## Output

Always show full content. Format as markdown:

```
# <project name>

Status: X | Dates: <range or —> | Favorite: ✓/✗
Tasks: N open · N done · N overdue

---

<full page content as markdown>
```

The task counts come from the project's rollup/formula properties (`# Open`, `# Done`, `Overdue Tasks Count`). If `Tasks Overview` (formula) is populated, you may surface it instead. Map blocks: paragraph → text, headings → #/##/###, bullets → -, numbered → 1., to_do → checkboxes, code → fenced, quote → >, callout → > with icon.
